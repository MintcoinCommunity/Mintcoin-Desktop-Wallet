See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Bitcoin QT, the
graphical user interface.

This details the command-line build.

You probably need to install XCode.

The easiest path is to use HomeBrew:

https://brew.sh/

Then:

brew install boost openssl miniupnpc berkeley-db@4

Now you should be able to build mintcoind:

cd mintcoin/src
make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./mintcoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./mintcoind -daemon # to start the bitcoin daemon.
Run
  ./mintcoind help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands

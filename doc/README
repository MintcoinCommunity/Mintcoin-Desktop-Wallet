the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/).  This product includes

Intro
-----
MintCoin is a free open source project derived from NovaCoin, with the
goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based
crypto-currency.  Built on the foundation of Bitcoin and NovaCoin,
innovations such as proof-of-stake help further advance the field of
crypto-currency.

Setup
-----
On Linux, build the Qt application, or unpack the files into a
directory and run:

 bin/32/mintcoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/mintcoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall or
forward port 12788 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive incoming
connections.  MintCoin works without incoming connections, but
allowing incoming connections helps the MintCoin network.


Upgrade
-------
All your existing coins/transactions should be intact with the
upgrade.

To upgrade first backup wallet:

mintcoind backupwallet <destination_backup_file>

Then shutdown mintcoind by:

mintcoind stop

Then start up the new mintcoind.

MintCoin-Qt: Qt5 GUI for MintCoin
=================================

Build instructions
===================

Debian
-------

These build instructions should work for Debian and derivative
systems, such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

We have some required packages. You can install these with `apt`:

::

    apt install qt5-qmake qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools \
        libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
        libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev \
        build-essential libboost-dev \
        libssl-dev libdb5.3++-dev libminiupnpc-dev

Next build the wallet:

::

    qmake
    make

An executable named `MintCoin-Qt` will be built.


Fedora
------

These build instructions should work for Fedora and derivative
systems, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Oracle Linux.

We have some required packages. You can install these with `dnf`:

::

    dnf install gcc-c++ boost-devel openssl-devel libdb-cxx-devel \
        miniupnpc-devel qmake-qt5

Next build the wallet:

::

    qmake-qt5
    make

An executable named `MintCoin-Qt` will be built.


Windows
--------

Windows build instructions:

- Download the `QT Windows SDK`_ and install it. You don't need the Symbian stuff, just the desktop Qt.

- Download and extract the `dependencies archive`_  [#]_, or compile openssl, boost and dbcxx yourself.

- Copy the contents of the folder "deps" to "X:\\QtSDK\\mingw", replace X:\\ with the location where you installed the Qt SDK. Make sure that the contents of "deps\\include" end up in the current "include" directory.

- Open the .pro file in QT creator and build as normal (ctrl-B)

Mac OS X
--------

- Download and install the `Qt Mac OS X SDK`_. It is recommended to also install Apple's Xcode with UNIX tools.

- Download and install `MacPorts`_.

- Execute the following commands in a terminal to get the dependencies:

::

	sudo port selfupdate
	sudo port install boost db53 miniupnpc

- Open the .pro file in Qt Creator and build as normal (cmd-B)

Build configuration options
============================

UPNnP port forwarding
---------------------

To use UPnP for port forwarding behind a NAT router (recommended, as more connections overall allow for a faster and more stable bitcoin experience), pass the following argument to qmake:

::

    qmake "USE_UPNP=1"

(in **Qt Creator**, you can find the setting for additional qmake arguments under "Projects" -> "Build Settings" -> "Build Steps", then click "Details" next to **qmake**)

This requires miniupnpc for UPnP port mapping.  It can be downloaded from
http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/.  UPnP support is not compiled in by default.

Set USE_UPNP to a different value to control this:

+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USE_UPNP=- | no UPnP support, miniupnpc not required;                                 |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USE_UPNP=0 | (the default) built with UPnP, support turned off by default at runtime; |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USE_UPNP=1 | build with UPnP support turned on by default at runtime.                 |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Notification support for recent (k)ubuntu versions
---------------------------------------------------

To see desktop notifications on (k)ubuntu versions starting from 10.04, enable usage of the
FreeDesktop notification interface through DBUS using the following qmake option:

::

    qmake "USE_DBUS=1"

Generation of QR codes
-----------------------

libqrencode may be used to generate QRCode images for payment requests. 
It can be downloaded from http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en, or installed via your package manager. Pass the USE_QRCODE 
flag to qmake to control this:

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USE_QRCODE=0 | (the default) No QRCode support - libqrcode not required                 |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USE_QRCODE=1 | QRCode support enabled                                                   |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

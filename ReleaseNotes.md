# 2.1.0-beta1

_Welcome back, MintCoin!_

This is the first release of MintCoin in more than 2 years. The
primary focus has getting the code working on modern systems, as well
as fixing the most painful user issues.

* Peers updated from DNS  
  https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/pull/43

  No longer will you have to give hints to the wallet so it can know
  where to connect by setting `addnode=` in your `MintCoin.conf`. An
  initial set of peers is pulled from the DNS.

  Note: We are looking for more people to run a DNS server. Scripts to
  set this up are in the
  [MintCoin-DNS-lookup-server](https://github.com/shane-kerr/MintCoin-DNS-lookup-server)
  repository.

* Fix for out-of-memory in Windows 32-bit wallet  
  Building the Qt wallet for Windows to be "large address aware" fixes
  the crashing that many Windows users experience.

* Support for ARM CPU

  The wallet can run on single-board computers (SBC) if they have
  enough RAM (about 2 gigabyte).

  distributions), Windows, and macOS builds.

  There have been quite a few other small fixes and documentation
  changes.
